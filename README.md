==================================
This is a script that creates a new page to see timetables at The University of Liverpool. I created this script because there there weren't any alternative to ugly Liverpool Life if you use laptop/desktop.

**Note!** This script is in early stage of development and could contain errors that are not solved yet.

###Main features
- You don't have to enter to Liverpool Life and try to reach timetables. Now you can check them with just one click!
- Modern, material-design-based style
- Left side panel shows lectures that are today (or tomorrow if it is evening or Sunday)
- Exporting data to your calendar (iCalendar format). Compatible with all major calendar apps (Outlook.com, Google Calendar etc.)
- Easy navigation between weekly timetables

###Installation
In order to use this script you have to install proper extension for your browser:
##### Google Chrome
* [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

At the moment, the script is only supported in Google Chrome. Mozilla Firefox and Opera compability is expected soon.

### Download
You can download and install the script from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/17806-better-uol-timetables).
You can also download the script directly from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoJk0/JJK-UoL-Timetables/master/betterUoLTimetables.js). However this option doesn't update automatically.

### Usage
To open timetables page enter

> ####liv.ac.uk/timetables

If you installed the script properly, the login page should appear. Otherwise you will see 404 error.
