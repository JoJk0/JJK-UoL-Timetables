Better UoL: Timetables 0.1
==================================
This is a script that creates a new page to see timetables at The University of Liverpool. I created this script because there there weren't any alternative to ugly Liverpool Life if you use laptop/desktop.

###Main features
- You don't have to enter to Liverpool Life and try to reach timetables. Now you can check them with just one click!
- Modern, material-design-based style
- Left side panel shows lectures that are today (or tomorrow if it is evening or Sunday)
- Exporting data to your calendar (iCalendar format). Compatible with all major calendar apps (Outlook.com, Google Calendar etc.)
- Easy navigation between weekly timetables

###Installation
In order to use this script you have to install proper extension for your browser:
##### Google Chrome

You can also download the script directly from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoJk0/JJK-UoL-Timetables/master/betterUoLTimetables.js). However this option doesn't update automatically.
